# sterzik/di

This is a simple dependency-injection library. The goals of this library are:

* easy to use
* project independent
* compatible with symfony-like services
* designed to cover basic functions of the symfony DI component
* intended for microservices, where the full-featured DI component is too expensive
* easily being integrated in existing projects
* support symfony-like autowiring feature
* handle even more complicated scenarios including circular references
* configuration is not compatible with the symfony DI component
